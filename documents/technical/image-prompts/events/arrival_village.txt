Generate a single unified anime illustration. Figure 1 is the protagonist (a young alchemist girl). Figure 2 is the village mayor (an elderly man). The mayor (Figure 2, on the left) is warmly welcoming the protagonist with a broad smile, one arm gesturing toward a small old cottage behind him as if presenting it. The protagonist (Figure 1, on the right) looks surprised and a little overwhelmed, eyes wide, hands clasped together. She is carrying a large brown leather backpack on her back, as she has just arrived from a long journey. They stand in front of a small run-down cottage that will be the protagonist workshop — cracked stone walls, ivy growing on it, a crooked wooden door, a chimney. The village is a tiny poor frontier hamlet with thatched-roof houses, low wooden fences, unpaved dirt road, wild grass. Green hills and forest in the far background, warm late afternoon light. Foreground characters drawn with clean sharp crisp anime outlines and vivid cel-shaded coloring. Background in soft watercolor painted style, muted earthy tones. NOT photorealistic, painted style like Studio Ghibli or Atelier game series. Visual novel event CG quality.
