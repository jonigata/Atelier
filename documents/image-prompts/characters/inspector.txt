A tall thin man in his late 40s, guild inspector. Neatly slicked-back silver hair without a single strand out of place. Grey emotionless businesslike eyes that miss nothing. Thin oblong face with hollow cheeks, stern tight mouth, thin silver rectangular frame glasses. Very tall and thin, posture uncomfortably straight and rigid. Black frock coat with white shirt underneath, guild emblem tie pin, always carrying a clipboard under arm. Polished immaculate black leather shoes. Quill pen and portable ink pot.
