A stocky large man in his early 40s, blacksmith. Black short hair held down by a headband, thick sideburns. Dark brown narrow sharp eyes that look like glaring but just concentrating. Square jaw, thick eyebrows, old burn scar on bridge of nose, perpetually grumpy stern expression. Very muscular build, especially thick arms with scattered burn marks on forearms. Soot-stained thick leather apron over grey shirt with rolled-up sleeves. Steel-toed sturdy work boots. Hammers and tools tucked into belt.
