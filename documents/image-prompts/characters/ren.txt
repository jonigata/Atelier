A stoic young male adventurer and swordsman in his early 20s. Iron-grey short hair swept back casually, with a faint old scar on his left temple. Steel-grey eyes, hard to read emotions. Slightly angular jawline, lean and sharp face, minimal expressions. Tall and lean build but muscular underneath, light and agile movement. Wearing a muted dark green hooded cloak over black light leather armor. A one-handed sword at his hip. Soft leather boots that make no sound. Leather cord wrapped around left wrist as a charm.
