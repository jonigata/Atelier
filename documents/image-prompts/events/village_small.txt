A tiny remote rural hamlet seen from slightly above, bird's eye overview. Only 2-3 small aged stone and timber cottages with thatched roofs, overgrown with moss and ivy. Unpaved dirt road, wildflowers growing through cracks. Surrounded by rolling green hills and dense forest. An old stone well in the center. Very quiet, few signs of life, slightly melancholic atmosphere. Soft watercolor anime style, hand-painted illustrated background, NOT photorealistic, painted style like Studio Ghibli or Atelier game series, muted earthy tones, miniature diorama feel, game UI illustration.
